# CodingChallenge
This code was developed as a response to a training course application question.

Instructions from the application were as follows:

Write a function that prints all numbers between 1 and 50, skipping any multiple of 7 and replacing them with inspirational quotes.  The function name should be skipMultiples, in any language you like.
